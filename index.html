            <p> Hello All! I am Geographic Information Systems Analyst worked in WIPRO LTD (clipped to UBER TECHNOLOGIES) for 11 months starting from 2022 september till 2023 July with proficiency of ARC GIS webservers which I constantly used to custamize UBER maps for their friendly user experience. Here, I have learned about the different databasealong with their structure, data manupulation, and how the maps are used in live traffics. Continuely working hard to improove my standards of the deliverables for the clients.</p>

            <h3>PROJECTS</h3>
            <p>Study of spatial and temporal trends of Microplastics in surface water and sediment coloumn of Sankarabarani (Pondicherry) sub basin and analysing the extent of pollution using the result obtained from the
            analysis where the microplastic sediment deposition in the coastal area is denser than the industrial area deposition because of early industrialization in the mouth areas. </p>
            <p>ArcGIS tools were used to predict the future extent of the pollution caused by the Microplastics.</p>
            <p>Analysing the temporal distribution via depth to know the extent of pollution and correlating the origin of the Microplastic pollution.</p>
